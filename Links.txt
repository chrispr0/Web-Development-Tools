RESETTING USER AGENT STYLESHEETS
  1 Create a reset.css file.
  2 Copy and paste CSS reset rules into the reset.css file.
  3 Link to reset.css in the HTML file (make sure reset.css is loaded first before other CSS files, otherwise reset.css may reset your custom rules by accident).

 POLYFILLS
  One example of a polyfill is Modernizr. To use Modernizr:
    Navigate to the website (https://modernizr.com/) and click "Download."
    Click the + next to any features you want to polyfill.
    Click "Build."
    Click "Download" next to the "Build" option in the resulting pop-up. This will prompt you to download a JavaScript file (the polyfill code).
    Place the downloaded .js file (JavaScript file) into the corresponding folder in your website's directory.
    Link the JavaScript file using a <source> tag in your index.html file.
    Use CSS to target elements that have the detected feature using .feature-name. To target elements that don't have the detected feature use .no-feature-name. The code feature-name is intended to represent the actual CSS feature.
